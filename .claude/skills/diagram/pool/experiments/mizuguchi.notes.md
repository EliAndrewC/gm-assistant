# Design notes: Mizuguchi (水口, "water mouth") - scripted hamlet, water entering from the west

*One of four demo maps from the scripted-generation experiment (2026-08-11). See
[`../../hamletgen.py`](../../hamletgen.py) for the pipeline and
[`inashiro.notes.md`](inashiro.notes.md) for the head-to-head with the authored Ikegami.*

**Kanji triangle**: 水 *mizu* "water" + 口 *kuchi/guchi* "mouth". Mizuguchi, "the water mouth" - the
intake itself, the sluice where the brook is turned into the head-race. A hamlet named for the one
piece of engineering that makes it possible.

**Subject**: the smallest of the four - ~12 households on land falling due EAST, so its head sluice
stands on the western margin and the comb fans away from it across the map.

**What it is here to show**: that the pipeline is not oriented. Every stage works in the fall frame,
so a map whose land falls east is not a special case: the intake is still at the head, the drain
still crosses the low side, the marsh is still on the toe, and the cluster still takes a margin with
its back to the high ground. Its `cross` lane skeleton and `round` cluster were rolled, not chosen.

**Known open**: shares Inashiro's two - the bare comb floor on the fan's shoulders (inherited from
`build_comb`), and a windward quarter derived from the slope rather than declared regionally.
