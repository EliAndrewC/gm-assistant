# Design notes: Sawada (沢田, "marsh paddy") - scripted hamlet, the OFF-MAP drain

*One of four demo maps from the scripted-generation experiment (2026-08-11). See
[`../../hamletgen.py`](../../hamletgen.py) for the pipeline and
[`inashiro.notes.md`](inashiro.notes.md) for the head-to-head with the authored Ikegami.*

**Kanji triangle**: 沢 *sawa* "marsh, mountain stream" + 田 *ta/da* "paddy". Sawada, "the paddy by
the marsh" - the name states what the map has to draw correctly: the reclaimed rice stops where the
undrained valley toe begins.

**Subject**: ~19 households, land falling to the northwest, and the largest of the four combs.

**What it is here to show**: the OTHER water sink. Sawada has no pond. Its collector runs on past
the last paddy as a brook and leaves the frame, to join a stream or another farm's ditch somewhere
the map does not have to care about - which is what most real valleys do, and which the GM's brief
named as the equally-ordinary alternative to a tameike. The brook's LENGTH is derived from the
distance to the canvas edge along the fall, not from a constant: `draw_comb_field`'s own brook runs
a fixed 520 px, which is a number tuned against the canvases the authored maps happened to use and
stops in open ground on a wider one.

Below the drain, the un-reclaimed toe is reed marsh - the `hinterland` scatter's contour band, on
the low side where the gate requires it.

**Known open**: shares Inashiro's two - the bare comb floor on the fan's shoulders (inherited from
`build_comb`), and a windward quarter derived from the slope rather than declared regionally.
