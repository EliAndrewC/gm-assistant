# Future work: towns

**A town is its own thing, and this file exists because it is not obviously either of its
neighbours** (GM 2026-08-24). It has storefronts, inns, caravans and a theater, which a farming
community does not; it has a farmers plurality and no wall-and-ward apparatus, which a provincial
city does. Filed with cities in the first cut of this split, and pulled out the same day because
burying town material inside the capital-era backlog is how it stops being found.

**Thin today, and that is about where the work has been rather than about towns.** The 2026-08-24
audit found exactly one open town-specific item. Every hand-authored town (Ubame, Hirameki) is
FROZEN, and the town tier is NOT STARTED for scripted generation
([`../migration-plan.md`](../migration-plan.md)) - so nothing has been generating town defects to
find. Expect this file to fill when the town tier converts, and treat its current emptiness as a
statement about attention, not about quality.

## OPEN: two `s.kiln` glyph defects (settlement-review on Ubame, 2026-08-17)

Both found on Ubame's new potters' kiln works and both deliberately NOT fixed there: they are
defects in `settlement/trades.py::kiln`, not in that map, and a shared-glyph change made under a
one-off content edit lands on Tango, Minami, Nagahara and `wip/shiro-daika` as well. The three
pool cities are frozen and would keep their committed ink either way, which is exactly why the
fix wants its own pass with its own sweep rather than riding along.

1. **The smoke wisp ignores the map's declared wind.** The plume is authored in the glyph's LOCAL
   frame (`q 2 -3.5 0.5 -7`, toward local -y), so it rotates with the kiln. On Ubame, at
   `rot=351.9`, that puts it at world bearing NNW - blowing INTO the declared `windward="NW"`, and
   pointing at the magistrate's manor. The SITING is right (the works is downwind of every
   dwelling) and only the ink contradicts it, which is the worst version: a reader who trusts the
   drawing reads the nuisance axis backwards. **Fix sketch**: derive the wisp's bearing from
   `meta["windward"]` in world coordinates and counter-rotate it out of the glyph's group, the way
   `_trade_record`'s `lab_off` already counter-rotates a caption. Then the plume becomes free
   evidence for the reader instead of a contradiction. Every settlement that draws smoke has the
   same latent bug; the kiln is just where a map finally rotated far enough to expose it.
2. **The two-cottage case is mirrored, with the well centered above it.** `cxs_ = {2: (-f(22),
   f(22))}` puts the pair symmetrically about the works' axis, and the private well's saturated
   blue disc sits centered above them - a bright centered mark over a symmetric pair, which is the
   composition the mirror rule warns about. It does not resolve into a face (one disc, not two),
   but at fit zoom the well becomes the loudest thing in the works and the eye lands on its least
   important object. **Fix sketch**: offset the 2-cottage case the way the 3-cottage case already
   is asymmetric in effect, or move the private well off the axis. Cheap, but it changes every
   two-cottage works, so it belongs with item 1 in one pass.
