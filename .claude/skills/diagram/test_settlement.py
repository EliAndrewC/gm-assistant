"""Unit tests for settlement.py methods/branches the pool generators don't exercise.

The five worked maps cover most of settlement.py; this file reaches the rest - a couple of
unused vocabulary methods (torii_path, forest/wall labels, polygon-based flower field) and a
few internal branches (degenerate segment, the road path of face-street rotation, the big->
plain ring fallback). Together with test_villages (which runs the gens in-process) this brings
settlement.py to 100%.
